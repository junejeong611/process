Voice.js
Purpose of the file/module:
This file provides an API endpoint that lets authenticated users convert text to spoken audio using the ElevenLabs text-to-speech service. When a user sends text to this endpoint, the server processes it through ElevenLabs and returns the generated audio file.
How it works:

Route Activation: When a user makes a POST request to /api/voice/tts, this code is triggered.
Authentication Check: The request passes through the auth middleware. This middleware verifies that the request includes a valid authentication token. If authentication fails, the middleware would return an error response and stop execution.
Request Processing: The code extracts the text property from the request body using object destructuring.
Input Validation: It checks that text exists (not null/undefined), is a string, and isn't just whitespace (using trim()). If any of these checks fail, it immediately returns a 400 Bad Request error.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: The code calls the synthesizeSpeech function (imported from the elevenLabsService), passing the validated text. This function communicates with the ElevenLabs API and returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the audio data and content type.
Response Handling: On success, it sets the HTTP response header Content-Type to match the audio format (like 'audio/mpeg' or 'audio/wav') and sends the binary audio data directly to the client.
Error Handling: If anything goes wrong during the synthesis process, it catches the error and returns a 500 Internal Server Error with a JSON message.

How to use (API endpoints, function signatures, example usage):
API Endpoint Details

URL: /api/voice/tts
Method: POST
Authentication: Required (JWT token)
Content-Type: application/json
Request Body: { text: string }
Returns: Binary audio data with appropriate Content-Type header

Example Usage:
async function convertTextToSpeech(text) {
  const response = await fetch('https://your-api-domain.com/api/voice/tts', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text: text
    })
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    const errorData = await response.json();
    throw new Error(errorData.error || 'Failed to convert text to speech');
  }
  
  return response;
}
Dependencies:

express (for routing)
axios (for HTTP requests to ElevenLabs API)
dotenv (for environment variable management)
jsonwebtoken (for authentication)
mongoose (for database models)
bcrypt (for password hashing)
Node.js built-ins: fs, path, crypto

Environment/config requirements:

ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (required): Your ElevenLabs API key
ELEVENLABS_API_URL (required): The base URL for the ElevenLabs API
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID (required): The ID of the voice to use for synthesis
JWT_SECRET (required): Secret key for verifying JWT tokens
MONGODB_URI (required): MongoDB connection string
ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID (optional): The model to use for synthesis
AUDIO_FORMAT (optional): The audio format for the output (mp3, wav)
AUDIO_STABILITY (optional): Voice stability setting
AUDIO_SIMILARITY_BOOST (optional): Similarity boost setting
AUDIO_STYLE (optional): Style setting
AUDIO_SPEAKER_BOOST (optional): Whether to use speaker boost
AUDIO_CACHE_DIR (optional): Directory path for caching generated audio files
REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS (optional): Timeout for API requests in milliseconds
MAX_RETRIES (optional): Number of retries for failed API requests

Troubleshooting:
Common Issues:

Authentication errors (401/403):

Check that your JWT token is valid and correctly included in the request header.


"Failed to synthesize speech" error (500):

Verify your ElevenLabs API key is valid.
Check that the voice ID exists in your account.
Make sure you have sufficient credits in your ElevenLabs account.


Audio quality issues:

Try adjusting the AUDIO_STABILITY, AUDIO_SIMILARITY_BOOST, and AUDIO_STYLE settings.
Consider using a different voice ID or audio format.


Performance issues:

Set up audio caching by configuring AUDIO_CACHE_DIR.
For large text inputs, consider breaking them into smaller chunks.
